# Personal Website

This project contains a simple personal website structure based on provided screenshots.

## Structure

- `style.css`: The CSS file containing the styles for layout, colors (black, red, white theme), and basic responsiveness.

## How to View

2.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Notes

- The layout and styling are approximations based on the provided screenshots.
- Basic responsiveness is included, but further adjustments might be needed for optimal viewing on all devices.
